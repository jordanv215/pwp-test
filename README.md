## Final PWP Feedback

Your PWP looks great. It's mobile responsive and very clean, and your contact form works perfectly. Smooth scroll looks beautiful on your site, and overall, I don't really see anything that's worth dropping points.

The one suggestion I would make is that you write better Commit messages. As much as I like writing things like "changed a lot of things again" because it doesn't require any thought, it's not easy for someone else to read. Work on this during future projects.

Otherwise, it's perfect. Tier IV, easy. Great job.
